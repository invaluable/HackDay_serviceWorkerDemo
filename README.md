# Service Workers demo

This is a simple demo of using a service worker to cache resources. It was done for Hack Day at Invaluable.

Please do not take this as an example of style or best practices. It's totally just an experiment.

## Why?

Service workers are scripts that  run in the background, independently of the web page they’re loaded in.

### Why do native applications exist?

#### Web apps can’t quite match the experience of native
- Multi-threaded capabilities
- Offline capabilities
	- Background sync
	- Offline caching
- Cool features like Geofencing & Push notifications
- Performance

#### Not For long
- Web Workers for multi-threaded capabilities
- WebAssembly for performance
- Service workers for offline, etc.

### Progressive engagement
Give the user the best experience they can have. Everything from being offline to WebGL & 3D

Offline-first is 2016’s “responsive design”

### Cool stuff Service workers can do
- Offline caching
- Background sync
- Combine the two for incredible performant applications!
- Push Notifications
- Geofencing
- etc.

As an aside, I spent a lot of time working with Docker and Nginx.
