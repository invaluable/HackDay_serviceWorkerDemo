# Service Workers -- Invaluable Hack Day

Service workers are scripts that  run in the background, independently of the web page they’re loaded in.

## Why?
Browsers, and consequently the web, is changing. Rapidly.

### Why do native applications exist?

Where browsers are used is changing.

There are a lot of advantages to web apps.
- No gatekeeping in an app store
- lots of developers
- easy to get going
- can push updates at any time.
*Facebook tried web-only and it sucked.*

#### Web apps can’t quite match the experience of native
- Multi-threaded capabilities
- Offline capabilities
	- Background sync
	- Offline caching
- Cool features like Geofencing & Push notifications
- Performance

#### Not For long
- Web Workers for multi-threaded capabilities
- WebAssembly for performance
- Service workers for offline, etc.

### Progressive engagement
Give the user the best experience they can have. Everything from being offline to WebGL & 3D

Offline-first is 2016’s “responsive design,” the new UX Design Prom Queen.

### Cool stuff Service workers can do
- Offline caching
- Background sync
- Combine the two for incredible performant applications!
- Push Notifications
- Geofencing
- Just in Time dependency injection
- etc.

As an aside, I spent a lot of time working with Docker and Nginx.
